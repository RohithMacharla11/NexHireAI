/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for NexHireAI platform.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for most data. Each user has complete control over their own data tree.
 * Recruiters and Admins have read/write access to platform-level data like roles, assessments, and the question bank.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - Candidate data is nested under /users/{userId}, ensuring ownership.
 * - Platform data (/roles, /assessments, /questionBank) is managed by admins.
