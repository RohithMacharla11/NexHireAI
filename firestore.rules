/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for NexHireAI platform.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for all data. Each user has complete control over their own data tree.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All data is nested under /users/{userId}, ensuring that only the authenticated user can access their data. This includes assessments, questions, submissions, and learning roadmaps.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is implicitly denied by the rules structure.
 * - No admin roles are defined within the database itself. Any admin functionality should be implemented outside of Firestore Security Rules.
 * - Data validation is relaxed during the prototyping phase to allow for rapid schema iteration.
